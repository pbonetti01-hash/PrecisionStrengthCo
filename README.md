The main focus was to build a clean, accessible, and high-performance website from scratch, practicing:
- **Semantic HTML5:** Using tags like `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<address>` for better SEO and accessibility.
- **Modern CSS3:** Implementing Flexbox, Grid, and CSS Variables for a scalable design.
- **Dark Mode:** A custom theme-toggle feature using JavaScript and `localStorage` to save user preferences.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `index.html`: Home page featuring membership plans.
- `about.html`: Company history, values, and FAQ.
- `hours.html`: Weekly schedule and peak hours table.
- `contact.html`: Functional contact form with validation.
- `css/styles.css`: Centralized styling with a mobile-first approach.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Interactive Theme:** Switch between Light and Dark mode.
- **Clean Forms:** User-friendly contact and inquiry forms.
